# Intro/Concepts
- It's important to understand programming as a way to become a creator of technology rather than just a consumer!
- The course aims to teach the basics of programming using Python, covering how to construct programs from simple instructions.

## Key points include:
1. Programming is about serving the user and creating useful applications.
2. A program is a sequence of stored instructions that the computer follows.
3. The course will help you transition from being a user to a programmer, focusing on the mechanics and language of programming.

## Differences between user and programmer perspectives:
### User Perspective:
- **Consumer Role:** Users interact with technology and applications to accomplish tasks without needing to understand the underlying code.
- **Focus on Functionality:** Users are primarily concerned with how to use software to achieve their goals, such as sending messages or browsing the internet.
- **Limited Technical Knowledge:** Users may not have in-depth knowledge of programming languages or how software is built.

### Programmer Perspective:
- **Creator Role:** Programmers design and build software, focusing on how to create applications that serve user needs.
- **Focus on Logic and Structure:** Programmers think about algorithms, data structures, and the flow of instructions to solve problems effectively.
- **Technical Knowledge:** Programmers have a deep understanding of programming languages, tools, and the hardware that runs the software.

## Hardware architecture and key components of a computer system:
- **Central Processing Unit (CPU):**
  The brain of the computer, executing instructions at high speeds (up to three billion instructions per second).
- **Main Memory:**
  Temporary storage where programs are loaded and executed.
- **Secondary Memory:**
  Permanent storage for files and programs, such as hard drives and USB sticks.
- **Input/Output Devices:**
  Tools for user interaction, like keyboards and screens.

- The discussion also covers the evolution of hardware from the 1960s to modern devices, emphasizing the increasing integration and miniaturization of components. 
The CPU operates through a **fetch-execute cycle**, retrieving instructions from memory to perform tasks.
Understanding these components is essential for grasping how programming and software interact with hardware.

## Fetch-execute cycle
The fetch-execute cycle is a fundamental process that the CPU uses to execute instructions.

### Fetch:
1. The CPU retrieves an instruction from the main memory.
2. The address of the instruction is stored in the Program Counter (PC), which keeps track of the next instruction to be executed.
3. The instruction is then loaded into the Instruction Register (IR).

### Decode:
4. The CPU decodes the instruction in the IR to understand what action is required.
5. This may involve determining which operands (data) are needed for the instruction.

### Execute:
6. The CPU performs the operation specified by the instruction.
7. This could involve arithmetic calculations, data movement, or interaction with input/output devices.

### Store:
8. If the instruction produces a result, it may be stored back in the main memory or in a register for future use.
9. The Program Counter is updated to point to the next instruction, and the cycle repeats.
10. This cycle allows the CPU to process instructions continuously, enabling the execution of programs.
